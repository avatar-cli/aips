# Avatar-CLI Improvement Proposals

## Introduction

The AIPs (or Avatar Improvement Proposals) are a set of formal specifications
written to guide the development of the Avatar CLI project.

They are divided into three groups:
  - `aips/development`:
    They define how the development process is organized.
  - `aips/features`:
    They specify which new features will be added, modified or deprecated.
  - `aips/architecture`:
    They define how `avatar-cli` must be structured internally (at the source
    code level).

AIP documents are numbered, and their filenames follow a common structure
(accepted file formats are md, rst & mediawiki):
  - `aips/development`: `dev-0000-short-title.md`
  - `aips/features`: `feat-0000-short-title.md`
  - `aips/architecture`: `arch-0000-short-title.md`
